    <h1>Module Appraisal (Beta)</h1>

    <p>This page can be used to get a very rough estimate of the price of
    abyssal modules. The process is somewhat awkward since there is no "copy
    external URL" option for modules like there is for killmails. To get an
    appraisal, please follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Find a chat channel that is empty or in which you will not annoy others.</li>

        <li>Drag the module you want to appraise into the chat box for that channel to create a hyperlink.</li>

        <li>Press enter to submit your message.</li>

        <li>Find your message, then right click it and press "Copy" (not "Copy all").</li>

        <li>Paste what was copied into the text box below and press submit.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Once the service has downloaded the stats of your module, it will
    redirect you to a dedicated page for that module. If a price estimate could
    be generated for the module it will be displayed on that page.</p>
