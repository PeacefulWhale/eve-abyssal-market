    Google Analytics in accordance with the manual for GDPR compliance
    published by the Dutch Data Protection Authority (DDPA or Autoriteit
    Persoonsgegevens) as published on 2018/08/15 with the exception of the
    recommendation of providing an opt-out. This means that the website
    administrator has: signed a data processing agreement with Google; has
    enabled IP address anonymisation; has disabled data sharing with Google;
    does not use other Google services in conjunction with Google Analytics
    cookies. The service stores potentially identifying data about users who
    have opted to log in, including EVE Online character names, identification
    numbers and OAuth2 access and refresh tokens. As mutaplasmid.space is
    open-source software, it is impossible for the website administrator to
    ensure that the aforementioned information is valid for all other running
    instances of this software. The webserver software used stores access logs
    containing IP addresses and page visits which are stored on a server
    located in the European Union.</p>
